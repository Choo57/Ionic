<h3>PROJECT DETAILS</h3>
Decided to learn Ionic to be able to build cross-platform mobile apps. At the time it was only supporting Angular, so it was also a good experience to work with Angular as well.<br/><br/>

Built and published this app on Google Play Store and Apple App Store while practicing Ionic and Angular. At the time, we were having this challenge with catching my kids' school bus on time (details in the Youtube video below), so I thought why not hit two birds with one stone..

<h3>PLAY STORE / APP STORE DESCRIPTION</h3>
MyTurn is a simple, free app that will enable you to inform your customers about your wait list/queue and notify them when their turn comes. 

Simply download the app, create your room and start adding your customers to the list. Once your customers download the app and join your room, they will be able to see the queue status in real time and get notified when their turn comes.

No need to purchase any extra hardware, subscribe or create an account. MyTurn is ready for use right after it's downloaded, which makes it easy for you and your customers to get connected.

Features:
- Available in multiple languages (English, Arabic, Turkish, Greek)
- Ability to send a message to your room (e.g. if there is an emergency, you have a promotion, will be closed today, etc you can inform your customers)
- Automatic wait time measurement for fixed queues like school bus pickups
